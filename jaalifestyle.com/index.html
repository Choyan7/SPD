Please review our Privacy Notice, which also governs your use of jaalifestyle.com, to understand our practices.
<br>
<br>

<h3>3. FEES AND PAYMENT</h3>
a. Some portions of the JAA Lifestyle Service may have fees associated with them (each, a “Paid Service”). You will have the opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged before using a Paid Service. We may change fees for any portion of the JAA Lifestyle Service at any time. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in Euro.
b. You are solely responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with your JAA Lifestyle Service account in a timely manner with a valid payment method. By electing to purchase or otherwise use a Paid Service, you authorize JAA Lifestyle or its third-party payment processors to charge the credit card or other payment method identified by you (“Payment Method), which you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use, all applicable fees for that Paid Service, including all applicable taxes. For purchases of one-time Paid Services (i.e., not subscriptions), your Payment Method will be billed for that Paid Service on the date that you make the purchase.
<br><br>

jaalifestyle.com is a subscription service.  c. Applicable purchases of subscriptions to Paid Services:  Your "Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service. For example, if you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service on January 10th: (1) your Subscription Billing Date for your first monthly subscription and all other monthly subscriptions you purchase is the 10th of each month, (2) your Subscription Billing Date for your first annual subscription is January 10th of each year, and (3) your Subscription Billing Date for all subsequent purchases of annual subscriptions will be the next soonest 10th monthly calendar day after your date of purchase. Your Payment Method will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next month or year, as applicable. For any subscription to a Paid Service that you purchase after your Subscription Billing Date is established, your Payment Method will first be charged a pro-rata amount of the subscription fee for the number of days between the purchase date and the applicable Subscription Billing Date. Your Payment Method will then be charged the full periodic subscription fee for the next month or year, as applicable, on each Subscription Billing Date thereafter (or on the last day of the calendar month, if the last day of the calendar month occurs before the Subscription Billing Date for that month). <br>
d. For any subscription to a Paid Service, that subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription, or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews to avoid billing of the next period's (i.e., month’s or year’s) subscription fees to your Payment Method. We will bill the periodic subscription fee to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information). <br>
e. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to JAA Lifestyle may be shared by JAA Lifestyle with companies who work on JAA Lifestyle behalf, such as payment processors or credit agencies, solely for the purpose of checking credit, effecting payment to JAA Lifestyle and servicing your account. The terms of your payment will be based on your chosen Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution providing such Payment Method. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges. Check with your bank and credit card issuers for details. If your Payment Method for any Paid Service fails or your account is past due, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your JAA Lifestyle account upon demand, (ii) JAA Lifestyle may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (iii) JAA Lifestyle reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to one or more JAA Lifestyle Services or your account with JAA Lifestyle. Upon any such termination, you will remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees and charges relating to your account and your use of the JAA Lifestyle Service before termination.

	You acknowledge that you have read understood, and agree to be bound by these terms, including any future modifications. If at any time, you do not agree to these terms, please immediately terminate your use of the jaalifestyle.com system. <br>
	If you are using or opening an account with jaalifestyle.com on behalf of a company, entity, or organization (collectively, a “subscribing organization”) then you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of that subscribing organization with the authority to bind such organization to these terms and agree to these terms on behalf of such subscribing organization.

In the event that a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you will be required to accept such modified terms in order to continue to use the Service.

<br>
<br>

<h3>2. PRIVACY</h3>
Please review our Privacy Notice, which also governs your use of jaalifestyle.com, to understand our practices.
<br>
<br>

<h3>3. FEES AND PAYMENT</h3>
a. Some portions of the JAA Lifestyle Service may have fees associated with them (each, a “Paid Service”). You will have the opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged before using a Paid Service. We may change fees for any portion of the JAA Lifestyle Service at any time. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in Euro.
b. You are solely responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with your JAA Lifestyle Service account in a timely manner with a valid payment method. By electing to purchase or otherwise use a Paid Service, you authorize JAA Lifestyle or its third-party payment processors to charge the credit card or other payment method identified by you (“Payment Method), which you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use, all applicable fees for that Paid Service, including all applicable taxes. For purchases of one-time Paid Services (i.e., not subscriptions), your Payment Method will be billed for that Paid Service on the date that you make the purchase.
<br><br>

jaalifestyle.com is a subscription service.  c. Applicable purchases of subscriptions to Paid Services:  Your "Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service. For example, if you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service on January 10th: (1) your Subscription Billing Date for your first monthly subscription and all other monthly subscriptions you purchase is the 10th of each month, (2) your Subscription Billing Date for your first annual subscription is January 10th of each year, and (3) your Subscription Billing Date for all subsequent purchases of annual subscriptions will be the next soonest 10th monthly calendar day after your date of purchase. Your Payment Method will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next month or year, as applicable. For any subscription to a Paid Service that you purchase after your Subscription Billing Date is established, your Payment Method will first be charged a pro-rata amount of the subscription fee for the number of days between the purchase date and the applicable Subscription Billing Date. Your Payment Method will then be charged the full periodic subscription fee for the next month or year, as applicable, on each Subscription Billing Date thereafter (or on the last day of the calendar month, if the last day of the calendar month occurs before the Subscription Billing Date for that month). <br>
d. For any subscription to a Paid Service, that subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription, or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews to avoid billing of the next period's (i.e., month’s or year’s) subscription fees to your Payment Method. We will bill the periodic subscription fee to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information). <br>
e. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to JAA Lifestyle may be shared by JAA Lifestyle with companies who work on JAA Lifestyle behalf, such as payment processors or credit agencies, solely for the purpose of checking credit, effecting payment to JAA Lifestyle and servicing your account. The terms of your payment will be based on your chosen Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution providing such Payment Method. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges. Check with your bank and credit card issuers for details. If your Payment Method for any Paid Service fails or your account is past due, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your JAA Lifestyle account upon demand, (ii) JAA Lifestyle may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (iii) JAA Lifestyle reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to one or more JAA Lifestyle Services or your account with JAA Lifestyle. Upon any such termination, you will remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees and charges relating to your account and your use of the JAA Lifestyle Service before termination.
<br><br>

It is JAA Lifestyle policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. For more information, please go to JAA Lifestyle's DMCA Notification Guidelines, and we will promptly terminate without notice any User's access to our Service if that User is determined by JAA Lifestyle to be a “repeat infringer.” A repeat infringer is a User who has been notified by us of infringing activity violations more than twice or who has had a User Submission, or any other user-submitted content removed from the JAA Lifestyle Service more than twice. “User Submission” as used in these Terms means the upload and distribution of authorized digital content by a User of the JAA Lifestyle Service.
